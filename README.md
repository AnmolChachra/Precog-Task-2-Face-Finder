# Precog-Task-2-Face-Finder

anmol_work.py is the main file of the web app.

The files associated with web app are larger than 25 Mb, therefore the complete web app's link is present in the file "Complete WebApp".
trainCNN and MyCNN are the files for deep convolution neural network that is trained on image processed by python notebooks "Image Face Task" and "Face Alignment".

I was unable to store the images in mongodb, therefore I uploaded the zip file on google drive. The link is present in the file "DataLink"


Thanks
